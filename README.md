## Introduction

Retire HTML Parser is designed to parse HTML files generated by the [Retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) tool. Retire.js is a tool that helps detect vulnerable JavaScript libraries in web applications.

This script extracts information about vulnerable technologies, including their library name, version, URL, and associated vulnerabilities. It then presents this information in a more readable format, making it easier for developers and security professionals to review and address potential security issues.

## Usage

The script takes a single command-line argument, which is the path to the HTML file containing the Retire.js scan results. It will then display the parsed information about the vulnerable technologies and their associated vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup 4 (bs4)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
3. Save the report:
![Save report](images/save_report.png)
5. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python retire_html_parser.py <filename>
```

Replace <filename> with the path to the HTML file containing the Retire.js scan results.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of how the output of the script will look:
